Offline Teleporter  
==================
A bukkit plugin that let's you tp to offline players and vice versa


***Limited support at the moment (sorry)***

This Plugin is in **Beta** for the moment!
Everything in the Beta stage will have the version format: 0.# ! :)


Since this is my first plugin, i'll be //documenting every step so that people (like me(newbies)) can learn
from it and so that Advanced Programmers can easily help out (If they want to!) :)

--------------
- [X] ~~Tp to an offline Player~~
